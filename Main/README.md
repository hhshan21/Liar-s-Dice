# Liar's Dice ðŸŽ²

Liar's dice is a game of lie and deceit between 2 or more players through a game of dice!

## Playing the game

1. Each player is given a set of 5 dices with cups used for concealment.
2. At the beginning of each round, each player will shuffle their dices and looks at their dices while keeping it concealed from other players. 
3. A player(P1) will begin bidding, annoucing the face value with the minimum number of dice(s) that the player believes are under all of the cups in the game.
4. On the next player's(P2) turn, he/she will have 2 choices:
    a. make a higher bid - increasing either the quantity of the face value or the number of dices or both
    b. challenge P1's bid - essentially calling P1 a liar 
5. Once a bid is challenged, all the dices are revealed.
6. If the bid is at least as many of the face value as it is called, the bidder (P1) wins otherwise, P2 wins.

## Tech used

1. HTML
2. Javascript
3. CSS

## Learning points

Learn more about functions, DOM manipulation, OOP just to name a few!

## Challenges

Every step of the project was a challenge. From creating the players to incorporating the logic within the game.

## Improvements I might make

1. Add the theme song of POC as audio
2. Make it responsive
3. Change the dice colour to show matching dice faces when liar is being called (for easier visual)
