# Liar's Dice ðŸŽ²

Liar's dice is a game of lie and deceit between 2 or more players through a game of dice!

## Playing the game

1. Each player is given a set of 5 dices with cups used for concealment.
2. At the beginning of each round, each player will shuffle their dices and looks at their dices while keeping it concealed from other players. 
3. A player(P1) will begin bidding, annoucing the face value with the minimum number of dice(s) that the player believes are under all of the cups in the game.
4. On the next player's(P2) turn, he/she will have 2 choices:
    a. make a higher bid - increasing either the quantity of the face value or the number of dices or both
    b. challenge P1's bid - essentially calling P1 a liar 
5. Once a bid is challenged, all the dices are revealed.
6. If the bid is at least as many of the face value as it is called, the bidder (P1) wins otherwise, P2 wins.

## Common uses of this game

This game is commonly played as a drinking game at bars in Singapore.
It was also popularised due to the movie "Pirates of the Carribean" where William Turner (Orlando Bloom) bets against Davy Jones in the second instalment of the franchise.

## Challenges

Every step of the project was a challenge. From creating the players to incorporating the logic within the game.

## Improvements I might make

1. Change the dice colour when liar is being called - for easier visual
2. Refactor my codes to make it cleaner
3. Have better variable names
